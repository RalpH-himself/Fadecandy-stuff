# Fadecandy-stuff
Code to turn the light on in my room

The idea is to have a RasPi control two Fadecandies. There will be a python script running on the RasPi, which can be controlled with OSP (Open Sound Protocol).

For now, I have everything running on my PC with a loooooong USB cable. First steps will be to find nice looking colors, simple yet powerful animations, integration of OSP etc.
